<h1><strong>THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS<strong></h1>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is for creating a PowerShell API call to Cloudflare to get a list of all DNS zones and entries for using in backup or for review.

This will output to a .csv file which can then be manipulated as needed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h2>To do:</h2>

1. Figure out API code for getting DNS zone entries
2. Create code to loop through each one and output to spreadsheet
    1. Work out if better to output to a single spreadhseet or output to multiple spreadsheets.
        1. If using a single spreadsheet, then put each domain on a separate tab? - If doing, then needs more investigation on how to do.
3. Complete PowerShell code
4. Update Readme
5. Make content publically available in GitHub

~~<h2>Longer Term:</h2>~~

~~1. Add option to get specific domain(s) rather than all domains~~
